# React Projects Repository

Welcome to my **React Projects Repository**! 🚀 This repository contains various front-end projects built using **React, Vite, and TailwindCSS**. Each project is designed to enhance my skills in React development, state management, API integration, and UI/UX design.

## 📌 Projects

### 1. [React Movies App](https://react-movies-project1.netlify.app/)
A movie search and discovery app built using React and Appwrite. It allows users to browse trending movies, search for films, and view movie details.

### 2. [Random Joke Generator](https://randomjokegeneratorreact.netlify.app/)
A **basic Random Joke Generator** built using **React.js**, fetching programming-related jokes from the JokeAPI.

### 3. [React Currency Converter](https://reactcurrencyconv.netlify.app/)  
A **real-time currency converter** using the **Exchangerate-API**. It allows users to convert between currencies with live exchange rates, swap currencies, and view an intuitive UI for seamless conversion.  

### 4. [React Password Validator](https://reactpassvalidator.netlify.app/)
A simple password strength validator built with React, Vite, and Validator.js. It checks password strength and provides real-time validation feedback.

### 5. [Credit Card Validator](https://creditcardvalidatorreact.netlify.app/)
A lightweight and responsive credit card validator using React and Validator.js. It offers real-time validation of credit card numbers with clean UI feedback and instant results.

### 6. (More projects to be added...)
more react projects are to be added

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **React** - Component-based UI development
- **Vite** - Fast and optimized development environment
- **TailwindCSS** - Utility-first CSS for responsive design
- **Appwrite** - Backend-as-a-service (used for database and authentication in some projects)
- **TMDb API** (used in the Movies App)
- **JokeAPI** (used in the Random Joke Generator)
- **Validator.js** – For password and credit card validation

## 📖 Learning Approach
This repository contains **tutorial-based projects** and self-implemented features to improve my React skills. Each project helps me explore different aspects of front-end development, from API integration to UI design and state management.

## 💡 Future Plans
- Add more advanced React projects
- Explore state management libraries like Redux or Zustand
- Implement authentication and user-specific features in future projects
